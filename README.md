# Risk Assessment and Management for Software Development Project

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive risk assessment for a hypothetical software development project. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to identify, analyze, and manage potential risks using a structured approach.

## Purpose
The risk assessment aims to ensure that the project stays on time, within budget, and meets quality expectations by identifying key risks, evaluating their impact and likelihood, and developing strategies to mitigate them.

## Key Steps
1. **Project Scope**: Risk assessment focused on software development with a goal to manage technical, financial, and operational risks.
2. **Risk Identification**: Identified potential risks including software bugs, budget overruns, vendor delays, and staffing shortages.
3. **Risk Analysis**: Evaluated risks based on probability and impact, using a simple risk matrix to prioritize.
4. **Risk Management Plan**: Developed strategies to mitigate high-priority risks, such as hiring additional developers to handle staffing shortages and allocating additional funds to avoid budget overruns.
5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Planned regular reviews to adjust strategies as project conditions evolve.

## Risk Matrix
| Probability ↓ | Impact → | Low Impact  | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **High**      |           |             | Staffing shortages |Major system failure |
| **Medium**    |           |             |              | budget overrun |
| **Low**       |           |   Minor bugs      |   |

## Results and Learning
- Successfully identified and mitigated key risks.
- Provided an actionable plan for managing risks throughout the project lifecycle.
- Enhanced project stability by addressing high-probability and high-impact risks early in the process.
